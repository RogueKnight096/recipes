    <p> This recipe answers the question no one asked: what if chicken nuggets tasted like a gas station drink? The nuggets stay crispy while the soda reduces into a sticky, shiny glaze that looks like candy but smells like dinner. It’s bizarre, visually alarming, and somehow still very edible, which is the worst kind of success. </p>
    <p> Soda-glazed nuggets work because sugar caramelizes fast and traps saltiness underneath. The result is sweet, savory, and confusing in a way that makes people stare at the plate for a few seconds before committing. Perfect website material. </p>
