    <p>This recipe takes two foods that should never have met and forces them into the same sandwich. It looks like a normal grilled cheese at first glance, which is part of the problem. The outside is crispy and buttery, the inside is melted and stretchy, and then your brain realizes something has gone terribly off-script. It’s designed to confuse first, then oddly impress.
    <p>Marshmallow Grilled Cheese works because it abuses contrast. Sweet marshmallow melts into salty cheese, creating a flavor that shouldn’t cooperate but does anyway. It’s unsettling enough to be memorable, simple enough to make, and strange enough to deserve a spot on a website meant to grab attention.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li> 2 slices of bread</li>
        <li> 1 slice cheddar cheese</li>
        <li> 1 slice mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li> 6–8 mini marshmallows OR 1-2 large marshmallows</li>
        <li> 1 tablespoon butter</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Butter one side of each slice of bread. Place one slice butter-side down on a pan over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Add the instant ramen to the boiling water.</li>
        <li>Add cheddar, mozzarella, and marshmallows on top, then place the second slice of bread butter-side up.</li>
        <li>Cook until both sides are golden brown and the inside is fully melted, then remove and serve immediately.</li>
        <li>Enjoy your Marshmallow Grilled Cheese! If... you can.</li>
    </ol>
